The main change in our contracts involve the new custom Comparator:

- The class invariant now ensures that the comparator is a Proc.
- pre_start now uses the comparator to check if objects are comparable.
- post_merge_sort now uses the comparator to see if the array is sorted.

Other changes:

- pre_merge checks that array c is of proper size.
- post_merge checks subarray is sorted.
